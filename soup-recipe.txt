Bean Soup

Since I just made this recipe 30 minutes ago I thought it would be nice to share
it with everyone. It is a nice vegetarian, very light but yet filling recipe made
with beans and root vegetables. Very taste, rich in earthy flavors and just what
the doctor recommended in those cold winter days, or served cold in a hot summer
day, this dish has it all. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and here are a
list of ingredients:
- 400-500g Of Dried Beans (You can add more depending on how much you make, but
this is even better in larger quantities)
- 1 Carrot
- 1 Parsnip
- 1 Celery Root
- 1 Onion
- 1 Bell Pepper (any color will do)
- 2-3 Bay leaves
- 1 Cube of Soup base
- 1 Bunch of Dill
- 1-2 Sprigs of Thyme
- Salt
- Pepper
- A few leaves of mint (I usually use 1 or 2, no more)
- Tomato Paste
- Red Bell Pepper Paste

Preparation: A night before making this soup, thoroughly wash the dried beans then
set them to soak in cold water over night. The next day throw away the water the
beans sat in rinse them again in cold water. Prepare a large pot and put the beans
in it and add a few liters of water, set it on the flame and boil for a few minutes.
After this step throw away the water the beans boiled in and cover them again with
a few liters of hot water and continue cooking. Add the salt, pepper, sprigs of
thyme and the bay leaves and let it boil for 30 minutes. In the meanwhile chop up
the carrot, parsnip, celery root, onion and the bell pepper and add them to the
pot along with the cube of soup base. Continue boiling for another 30 minutes then
add the tomato paste and the red bell pepper paste to the pot. Cook for another
20-30 minutes and it is done. Chop the dill and the mint leaves and add them to the
pot and let it sit for 10 minutes before serving. Serve in a ceramic or wooden
bowl (decorate with dill or parsley) accompanied by a good bread. Enjoy your meal.

Tips: This is a light version version of the soup, in the winter months Romanians
usually add smoked meat to it to enrich its nutrient value for the harsh winters.
Also before adding the chopped vegetables to the soup they can be stir fried to
enhance the earthy flavor. If you have guests and want to impress them this soup
can be served in bread bowls,simply buy whole wheat round bread cut the top off
with a sharp knife and spoon the interior out leaving only 2 inches of bread inside.
